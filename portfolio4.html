                <b>Computer Hardware</b>
                <ul>Consists of physical elements that make up a computer system, facilitating basic operations such as input, output, processing, and storage. (Susnjara and Smalley, n.d.Computer hardware is the physical backbone of all computer systems, allowing software to execute, data to be processed, and users to interact with them. (Khan, 2025).

                <b>Types</b>

                <b>Computer Software</b>
                <ul>Is a collection of instructions that direct a computer system through tasks. It is divided into three categories: operating system (OS) software, utility software, and application software. A computer system is useless without software, just as a car is without a driver (Ferguson & Hebels, 2014).                </ul>

        <p class="text">In community institutions, computer hardware like affordable and powerful PCs and servers is used along with software such as operating systems and specific applications to support daily tasks and mandates efficiently. This approach is common across public and private sectors, including electoral bodies, schools, and libraries, enabling them to connect to networks and use tailored software for their unique needs. Such implementations make institutions more effective and accessible in serving their communities (ACE Project, 2024). </p>
