                <b>What are Number Systems? Why are they important? What are the different types of Number Systems? What are their uses/significance?</b> Number Systems are a set of symbols and rules that is used for number representation, or any system used for naming or number representation(Latif et. al., 2011). Defined by the set of values that each digit can adopt, as well as an interpretation rule that determines the mapping between the sequence of digits and their numerical values. They are important from the perspective of understanding how data is represented before it is processed by any digital system, including a digital computer (KL University, n.d.). (Wanhammar, 2007).

                The study of <b>decimal</b> and <b>binary</b> is obvious since they reflect how our brains comprehend the physical world (decimal) and how computers operate (binary). Logic circuits are used to create and transmit 1s and 0s in order to compute and convey binary information. And as humans, our brains have been trained to count, label, and measure using the decimal system. Furthermore, <b>Octal</b> is rarely used, but it is studied to demonstrate how the formalization of number systems can be applied to any system, regardless of the number of symbols they include. Lastly, <b>Hexadecimal</b> is explored because it is an efficient way of representing a large quantity of binary values with a little number of symbols. 
            </ul>
            <p>
                Learning about number systems helped me understand how data is represented and processed inside digital systems. Before, I only saw numbers as what we humans use for counting, measuring, or calculating, but now I see that different systems exist, each with its own specific purposes. The idea that computers rely on the binary number system, which only uses 0s and 1s, makes sense because digital components can only be in two states—on or off (Latif et al., 2011). This simple concept is actually the basis of how computers function.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also realized that the decimal number system, which we use in everyday life, is not universal in computing. It is just one of many possible systems. According to LaMeres (2024), the decimal system is most familiar to humans because it reflects how we naturally count, calculate, and measure things. On the other hand, computers use binary to process data efficiently, while hexadecimal is used for the simplification of the representation of long binary numbers. The octal system, though not as common today, still shows how flexible numerical representation can be (KL University, n.d.; Olajide, 2017).            </p>
            <p>
                What stood out to me most is how each number system serves a unique purpose. Binary is the foundation of all digital operations, decimal connects computing to human understanding, octal provides another way to group binary digits, and hexadecimal makes large binary values easier to handle (Wanhammar, 2007). Even though we mainly use only a few systems,  there truly isn’t a fixed number of how many number systems there are. Theoretically, there could be infinite number systems, each with its own base and symbols.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, studying number systems gave me a deeper appreciation for how computers translate data into something we can utilize and understand. It’s fascinating how these systems, though abstract, make all digital technology possible. Understanding them helps close the gap between how humans think in decimal and how machines operate in binary.            </p>
