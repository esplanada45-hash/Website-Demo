                A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules, produce information (output), and store the information for future use (Vermaat, 2014).             </p>
            <p>
                According to Becher (2024), Computers come in different types, each designed for specific functions and users. Here are their <b>descriptions and usages</b>, along with a sample image:
            </p>
                <b>Supercomputer</b>
                <ul>
                    A supercomputer is a high-performance system that solves complex computations by dividing tasks into several sections and processing them simultaneously using parallel processing. This enables it to process enormous amounts of data and do complex computations at high rates, essentially serving as a united collective computer. Supercomputers, with numerous CPUs, vast storage capacity, and quick input-output capabilities, are the world's fastest computers, doing one-quintillion computations per second. These massive machines, housed in warehouses, are used to mimic climate modeling, the development of the universe, nuclear weapons, and the decoding of encrypted information.

        <div class="text">
                <b>Mainframe</b>
                <ul>
                    Is a high-performance computer system built to support hundreds of thousands of end users simultaneously and quickly handle huge amounts of data in bulk. These fault-tolerant, refrigerator-sized devices, which are mostly utilized by large enterprises, are in charge of almost all credit card transactions worldwide and operate as the primary hub for crucial business applications. They are the safest and most dependable computers because they are constructed with redundant parts and specialized technology.

        <div class="text">
                <b>Minicomputer</b>
                <ul>
                    Contain multiple processors and are capable of handling hundreds of users at once while multitasking. Industrial control systems, scientific research, corporate transaction processing, file handling, and database administration are common uses for minicomputers, which are often dedicated to a single application.

        <div class="text">
                <b>Server</b>
                <ul>
                    On a shared network, a server is a specialized computer that transmits data to and handles requests from other "client" computers. The server, which can dependably manage several simultaneous requests, is where all data and applications are stored. It serves a variety of purposes, including web hosting, database administration, email services, and file storage, and gives in-network nodes access to resources, data, services, or applications.
                </ul>

                    One central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and peripherals such a keyboard, mouse, and monitor typically appear in these setups. They come in a variety of forms, including desktops, laptops, and tablets, each of which offers a unique blend of mobility, performance, and capability. They can run a broad range of software programs, from word processing and internet surfing to gaming and multimedia playback.
