                A single printed circuit board (PCB), often known as the system board or motherboard, serves at the heart of every PC. It contains the CPU, the system's memory, timing, and control functions, as well as external interface capabilities (I/O). They handle all data transactions between the CPU (central processing unit) and peripheral devices. Motherboards have developed significantly over time, from several interconnected PCBs to a multilayered design that incorporates numerous components into a compact package. This consolidation improves performance by enabling quicker data flow from the motherboard to peripheral devices.

                Different motherboard types serve specific needs. AT and LPX were early, now mostly outdated designs. ATX motherboards are the most common, balancing size and expandability. Extended-ATX (E-ATX) is a larger version for high-end systems with extra CPU and memory slots. Micro-ATX and Mini-ATX are smaller boards fitting compact cases but with fewer expansion options. Mini-ITX is even smaller, ideal for very compact or portable systems. BTX and Pico BTX were designed to improve airflow but didn't become widespread. Standard-ATX and Extended-ATX remain popular for full-sized desktops and workstations.
